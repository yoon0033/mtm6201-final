# My Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is a fashion portfolio website designed to help users fnd their style. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and it includes three main pages: Home, About, and Contact. The design is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks great on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop screens. This project allowed me to explore and apply various web development techniques, especially focusing on layout design, responsiveness, and user experience.

## Pages
- **Home**: Features a prominent hero section with a striking background image and a call-to-action button. It also includes an overlay effect to enhance text readability and a smooth, user-friendly layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **About**: This page provides information about the servies offered and the inspiration behind the fashion consultation services. Itt uses a combination of Bootstrap's grid system and custom CSS to create a clean and visually appealing layout.
- **Contact**: Includes a form where users can easily get in touch. The form elements are styled using Bootstrap classes, with custom enhancements to match the overall aesthetic of the site.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, utilizing Bootstrap’s grid system and custom media queries to ensure that it works well on all screen sizes, from 320px to over 2500px.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Bootstrap was extensively used for layout, grid, and responsive design. The grid system allowed for precise control over the layout across different devices.
- **Custom CSS**:  In addition to Bootstrap, custom CSS was used to override default Bootstrap variables, allowing for unique design elements such as custom colors, typography, and hover effects.
- **Google Fonts**: The website uses Google Fonts to enhance typography, ensuring that the text is both stylish and readable across all devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Semantic HTML5 was used to structure the website content, ensuring clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS & Bootstrap**: Custom CSS and Bootstrap were combined to create a responsive and visually appealing design. Bootstrap’s grid system was particularly useful for structuring the layout across different devices.
- **Google Fonts**: Google Fonts were utilized to provide a modern and consistent typographic style.

## Process
1. **Planning**:  I began by sketching the layout of the website, focusing on the user journey and how to best display fashion-related content. I identified key sections that needed to be included, such as the hero section, service descriptions, and a contact form.
2. **Development**:  Using HTML and Bootstrap, I built the basic structure of the website. The grid system allowed me to create a flexible layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. I then added custom CSS to refine the design, including custom colors and hover states for interactive elements.
3. **Customization**: CSS variables were utilized to override Bootstrap’s default styles, such as the primary color, background, and font sizes, ensuring that the design remained consistent with the fashion theme.
4. **Testing**: Validated HTML and CSS using online validators.

## Challenges
- **Grid System mastery**: Understanding and effectively using Bootstrap’s grid system to create a responsive layout was initially challenging. However, with practice, I was able to implement it successfully, ensuring that all content was displayed appropriately across different devices.
- **Custom CSS Intergration**:  Integrating custom CSS with Bootstrap required careful planning to avoid conflicts and ensure that the styles complemented each other. This process taught me a lot about CSS specificity and how to efficiently manage styles.
