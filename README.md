# My Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is a portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website includes three pages: Home, About, and Contact. The design is responsive and follows accessibility guidelines. The project showcases my skills in web development and design.

## Pages
- **Home**: Features a main image, three thumbnails, and a 'See All' button.
- **About**: Provides information about myself.
- **Contact**: Contains a form to contact me.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works on screen sizes from 320px to 2500px.
- **Accessibility**: The site follows accessibility guidelines, including alt text for images and proper ARIA roles.
- **Optimized Images**: Images are optimized for different screen sizes using the `<picture>` element.
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Utilized Bootstrap for layouts, typography, and components.
- **Custom CSS**: Custom styles are applied using CSS variables.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Semantic HTML5 elements are used for structure.
- **CSS**: Custom styles are defined in a separate CSS file.
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap framework is used for responsive design and components.
- **JavaScript**: Basic JavaScript for Bootstrap components.

## Process
1. **Planning**: Designed the layout and structure of the website.
2. **Development**: Built the HTML, CSS, and integrated Bootstrap.
3. **Optimization**: Optimized images and ensured responsiveness.
4. **Testing**: Validated HTML and CSS using online validators.

## Challenges
- **Responsive Images**: Ensuring that images respond correctly to different screen sizes was challenging. I used the `<picture>` element with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to handle this.
- **Accessibility**: Implementing accessibility features required careful consideration of ARIA roles and proper HTML syntax.
